        <h1>Mystic Moments</h1>
        <pre>
My muse, you move like morning mist,
Murmurs soft and moonlit-kissed.
Mended hearts in mellow light,
Merged as one in endless night.
    
Magnolia-scented, memories bloom,
Midnight whispers fill the room.
Mysteries in your gentle gaze,
Marking time in endless maze.
    
More than dreams, mere words, or art,
My love, you are my morningâ€™s start.
Marvel, miracle, my melody,
Mesmerized, my soul set free.
