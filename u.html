        <h1>Unspoken Union</h1>
        <pre>
Under starlit skies we meet,
Unfolding dreams beneath our feet.
Unseen threads our fates entwine,
Uniting hearts, a silent sign.

Unyielding faith, both soft and strong,
Understanding where we belong.
Undimmed light in endless night,
Unveiling love, pure and bright.

Untouched by time, by doubt or fear,
Universe holds us ever near.
Unbound, unbroken, through and through,
Until the stars fade, I am with you.
