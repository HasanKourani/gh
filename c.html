        <h1>Celestial Connection</h1>
        <pre>
Caught beneath a cosmic spell,
Close to you, where stars compel.
Cradled in a quiet grace,
Captured by your warm embrace.

Chasing dreams that shimmer bright,
Calm and sure, our souls unite.
Colors blend, like dawn’s first light,
Crafting love, pure and right.

Constant, clear, like ocean’s hue,
Centered deep in thoughts of you.
Cherished now, forevermore,
Connection vast, a boundless shore.
