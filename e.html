        <h1>Eternal Embrace</h1>
        <pre>
Endlessly, I’m entranced by you,
Every echo, soft and true.
Eager eyes meet emerald skies,
Entwined in whispers, endless ties.

Every touch, electric fire,
Eases sorrow, sparks desire.
Ephemeral yet ever near,
Each heartbeat draws you here.

Eclipsed by love’s eternal grace,
Enduring warmth, our sweet embrace.
Even time, with fleeting pace,
Exists for us, a sacred space.
