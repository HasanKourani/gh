        <h1>Yearning Yielded</h1>
        <pre>
You, the song my soul has known,
Yearning whispers, softly sown.
Yielding to a gentle grace,
Yours, a light I can’t replace.

Yellow dawn breaks through the night,
Yet still, you shine, my guiding light.
Years may pass, and seasons fade,
Yet our love will never trade.

Yonder skies and endless seas,
You’re the calm, the sweetest peace.
Yoked in heart, bound and true,
You are my forever view.
